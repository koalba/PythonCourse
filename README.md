Well... I'm taking a Python course, and I'm going to document a bit my journey. At first I'll probably write less ( because easy ) but who knows if I end up writing more! For now, just an explanation of the course little exercises I've been doing, you can see all of them in this repository. <br /><br />
Lots of love!<br /><br />

### · Password Generator · <sub><sup>FINAL WORK</sup></sub>
Write a Random Password Generator with the amount of letters, symbols and numbers chosen by the user. <br />
In this project I learnt about the existence of ` random.sample( sequence, k ) ` that uses the items of a sequence ( list , string, ... ) and a length to generate a randomized result.
~~~ python
import random
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 

random.sample( list , 3 ) 
# E.g. Output : [2, 3, 5]
~~~

In this case, I used it to randomize the position of the characters of the password:
~~~ python
''.join( random.sample( password, len( password ) ) )
~~~

### · The Hurdles Loop Challenge - Escape the Maze · <sub><sup>FINAL WORK</sup></sub>
Challenge: 
[Reeborg's World - Maze](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json) <br />

Reeborg was exploring a dark maze and the battery in its flashlight ran out. </br>
Write a program using an if/elif/else statement so Reeborg can find the exit. The secret is to have Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze, turning right if it can, going straight ahead if it can’t turn right, or turning left as a last resort. </br>

|![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34134103/231523937-0f6ea0e9-4ab7-420d-a860-aa3cd20241ed.png)|![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34134103/231523731-049497c7-6cc7-477d-a45d-3e396951872e.png)|

It took me more than I'd like to admit because I started with a completely wrong mindset about how to complete it... I had to sit back and really figure out how everything should work. </br>
I's funny because there is a place in the maze that would make the robot go on a loop, making a square. I fixed this making it so the robot can only turn right two times in a row. <br />

My solution:
~~~ python
def lookNorth():
    while not is_facing_north():
        turn_left()

def lookRight():
    for n in range(0, 3):
        turn_left()
        
count = 0

def detectWalls():
    global count
    
    if right_is_clear() and count <= 1:
        count += 1
        lookRight()
    elif not right_is_clear() and not front_is_clear():
        turn_left()
        count = 0
    else:
        count = 0
        
lookNorth()        

while not at_goal():
    detectWalls()
    if front_is_clear() : move()
else:
    done()

## DAY 8 - Function Parameters & Caesar Cipher:

### · Paint Area Calculator ·
You are painting a wall, the instructions on the paint says that **1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall**. <br />
Given a random size of the wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy. <br /> <br />
`number of cans = ( wall height * wall width ) / coverage per can`  <br />

### · Prime Number Checker ·
Prime numbers are numbers that can only be divided by itself and 1. <br />
You need to write a function that checks wether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not. <br /><br />
In this case I made a little library with the different answers to if it was or not a prime number, so I could use them multiple times but change it only once if necessary. <br />

~~~ python
answers = {
    'it_is'     : 'It\'s a prime number.',
    'it_is_not' : 'It\'s NOT a prime number.'
}
~~~

The Caesar Cipher ( or Caesar Code ) is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter is replace by another located a little further. This shift distance is based on an offset. <br />

In the course project, you have to know the offset to decode the message, but I wanted to be able to decript the message either way. For that, I just checked all possible offsets that can be made in the alphabet. <br />

~~~ python
for n in range( 0 , len( alphabet )):
  caesar( direction , text , n )

## DAY 9 - Dictionaries, Nesting and the Secret Auction:

### · Grading Program ·

You have access to a database of `student_scores` in the format of a dictionary. The keys of the dictionary are the names of the students, and the values are their exam scores. <br />
Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of the program, you should have a dictionary called `student_grades` with the same structure as the other. <br />
Coding criteria: <br />
- Scores 91 - 100 : 'Outstanding'
- Scores 81 - 90  : 'Exceeds Expectations'
- Scores 71 - 80  : 'Acceptable'
- Scores 70 or lower  : 'Fail'

Make a calculator. In the project she said to ask three questions, the first number, the operator, and then the second number. I wanted to be able to write the operation itself, and that gave me the problem of... ¿What if I want to write a complicated operation that has more than two numbers? And of course I have to follow the order so multiply and so on goes first, then sum and subtraction, etc. <br />

After thinking a bit, I created a while loop to run until I have my result, first, I check all the multiplication, division, etc. and substitute the values used in the list for the result of the calculation. When I finish that, I check for all the other operations until I get just one value, my result.

~~~ python
while len(numbers) > 1:
        for i, n in enumerate( numbers ):
            if n == '*' or n == '/' or n == '%' or n == '^' or n == 'x':
                numbers[i] = calculate( float(numbers[i - 1]), n , float(numbers[i + 1]) )
                numbers.pop( i + 1 )
                numbers.pop( i - 1 )
        else:
            for i, n in enumerate( numbers ):
                if n == '+' or n == '-':
                    numbers[i] = calculate( float(numbers[i - 1]), n , float(numbers[i + 1]) )
                    numbers.pop( i + 1 )
                    numbers.pop( i - 1 )
~~~

Also, I learnt about the `operator` module, that exports a set of efficient functions corresponding to each Python operator. ` operator.add( a , b ) ` its equivalent to the expression `a + b`. <br />

Thanks to it, I can make a dynamic calculation without worrying about doing all the if's statements for all the individual operators.

~~~ python
import operator

ops = {
    '+' : operator.add,
    '-' : operator.sub,
    '*' : operator.mul,
    'x' : operator.mul,
    '/' : operator.truediv,
    '%' : operator.mod,
    '^' : operator.xor,
}

result = ops[ operation ]( first_number , second_number ) # operation = '+' or '-' or '*'...

I really enjoyed this project, It had a lot more to it than the last ones. I added that, when you don't input enough money, instead of just giving it back and restarting everything, you can choose between adding more coins or just cancel the order and start again.
<br />

Also, I looked for ASCII Art on the internet of a coffee machine but couldn't find anything nice, so in the end I created my own which I'm actually really proud of.

## DAY 16 - Object Oriented Programming (OOP):

### · The Coffee Machine (OOP) · <sub><sup>FINAL WORK</sup></sub>

Same as before, but re-writting it with objects. <br/> 

I've made a Menu, MenuItem, CoffeeMaker and MoneyMachine classes, and each manage one part of the whole Coffee Machine. This way, the main code stays cleaner and more readable, and also, it is more modular and replicable.</br>

In this project, I wanted to give a bit more of attention to commenting and typing, so that my code could be more readable and understandable. For this, I researched Commenting Best Practices and how to type variables, parameters and functions in Python.
~~~ python
def manage_money( self , total : float , cost : float ):
        """Adds the cost of the drink to the machine profit and gives back the change.

        :total: (float) Total of the payment.
        :cost: (float) Cost of the drink.
        """
        self.profit += cost

        change : float = round(total - cost, 2)
        print( f"\n    Here is your ${ change } in change." ) if not total == cost else ''

Write a Quiz Game using the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/).<br>

She takes the json given by the Open Trivia Database, copy it and transform it on the project, but I wanted to go a bit further and investigate how to use the Trivia API, how to recollect the data and actually let the user choose the difficulty of the Quiz.
~~~ python
import requests, json

def get_data( difficulty : str ):
    res = requests.get(f'https://opentdb.com/api.php?amount=25&type=boolean&difficulty={ difficulty }')
    data = json.loads( res.text )
    return data['results']
