# Python Course
🟢 **Course:** [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) by Dr. Angela Yu <br /><br />
Well... I'm taking a Python course, and I'm going to document a bit my journey. At first I'll probably write less ( because easy ) but who knows if I end up writing more! For now, just an explanation of the course little exercises I've been doing, you can see all of them in this repository. <br /><br />
Lots of love!<br /><br />

### · Password Generator · <sub><sup>FINAL WORK</sup></sub>
Write a Random Password Generator with the amount of letters, symbols and numbers chosen by the user. <br />
In this project I learnt about the existence of ` random.sample( sequence, k ) ` that uses the items of a sequence ( list , string, ... ) and a length to generate a randomized result.
~~~ python
import random
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 

random.sample( list , 3 ) 
# E.g. Output : [2, 3, 5]
~~~

In this case, I used it to randomize the position of the characters of the password:
~~~ python
''.join( random.sample( password, len( password ) ) )
~~~

🟢 [See Project](https://github.com/koalba/PythonCourse/tree/main/04_DAY5/02_PasswordGenerator)

## DAY 6 - Python Functions & Karel:

Reeborg has entered a hurdles race. Make him run the course, following the path shown. <br />

My solution:
~~~ python
def jump():
  move()
  turn(1)
  turn(3)
  turn(3)
  turn(1, False)

def turn(num, m = True ):
    for n in range(0,num):
        turn_left()
    if m :
        move()

for n in range(0, 6):
    jump()
~~~

[Reeborg's World - Hurdle 3](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%203&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle3.json) <br />

Reeborg has entered a hurdle race. Make him run the course, following the path shown.
The position and number of hurdles changes each time this world is reloaded. </br>

My solution:
~~~ python
def jump():
    turn(1)
    turn(3)
    turn(3)
    turn(1, False)
    
def turn(num, m = True ):
    for n in range(0,num):
        turn_left()
    if m :
        move()
    
while not at_goal():
    while front_is_clear() and not at_goal():
        move()
    else:
        jump()
~~~

### · The Hurdles Loop Challenge - Random position, height and number ·
Challenge: 
[Reeborg's World - Hurdle 4](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Hurdle%204&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fhurdle4.json) <br />

Reeborg has entered a hurdle race. Make him run the course, following the path shown.
The position, the height and the number of hurdles changes each time this world is reloaded. </br>

My solution:
~~~ python
def jump():
    turn(1)
    turn(3)
    turn(3)
    turn(1, False)
    
def turn(num, m = True ):
    for n in range(0,num):
        turn_left()
    if m :
        if( not wall_on_right() ) : move()
        while wall_on_right() and front_is_clear():
            move()
    
while not at_goal():
    while front_is_clear() and not at_goal():
        move()
    else:
        if not at_goal() : jump()
else:
    done()

### · The Hurdles Loop Challenge - Escape the Maze · <sub><sup>FINAL WORK</sup></sub>
Challenge: 
[Reeborg's World - Maze](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json) <br />

Reeborg was exploring a dark maze and the battery in its flashlight ran out. </br>
Write a program using an if/elif/else statement so Reeborg can find the exit. The secret is to have Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze, turning right if it can, going straight ahead if it can’t turn right, or turning left as a last resort. </br>

|![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34134103/231523937-0f6ea0e9-4ab7-420d-a860-aa3cd20241ed.png)|![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34134103/231523731-049497c7-6cc7-477d-a45d-3e396951872e.png)|

It took me more than I'd like to admit because I started with a completely wrong mindset about how to complete it... I had to sit back and really figure out how everything should work. </br>
I's funny because there is a place in the maze that would make the robot go on a loop, making a square. I fixed this making it so the robot can only turn right two times in a row. <br />

My solution:
~~~ python
def lookNorth():
    while not is_facing_north():
        turn_left()

def lookRight():
    for n in range(0, 3):
        turn_left()
        
count = 0

def detectWalls():
    global count
    
    if right_is_clear() and count <= 1:
        count += 1
        lookRight()
    elif not right_is_clear() and not front_is_clear():
        turn_left()
        count = 0
    else:
        count = 0
        
lookNorth()        

while not at_goal():
    detectWalls()
    if front_is_clear() : move()
else:
    done()
~~~

🟢 [See Project](https://github.com/koalba/PythonCourse/tree/main/06_DAY7/00_HangmanGame)

## DAY 8 - Function Parameters & Caesar Cipher:

### · Paint Area Calculator ·
You are painting a wall, the instructions on the paint says that **1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall**. <br />
Given a random size of the wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy. <br /> <br />
`number of cans = ( wall height * wall width ) / coverage per can`  <br />

🟢 [See Project](https://github.com/koalba/PythonCourse/tree/main/07_DAY8/00_PaintAreaCalculator)

### · Prime Number Checker ·
Prime numbers are numbers that can only be divided by itself and 1. <br />
You need to write a function that checks wether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not. <br /><br />
In this case I made a little library with the different answers to if it was or not a prime number, so I could use them multiple times but change it only once if necessary. <br />

~~~ python
answers = {
    'it_is'     : 'It\'s a prime number.',
    'it_is_not' : 'It\'s NOT a prime number.'
}
~~~

🟢 [See Project](https://github.com/koalba/PythonCourse/tree/main/07_DAY8/01_PrimeNumberChecker)

### · Caesar Cipher · <sub><sup>FINAL WORK</sup></sub>

The Caesar Cipher ( or Caesar Code ) is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter is replace by another located a little further. This shift distance is based on an offset. <br />

In the course project, you have to know the offset to decode the message, but I wanted to be able to decript the message either way. For that, I just checked all possible offsets that can be made in the alphabet. <br />

~~~ python
for n in range( 0 , len( alphabet )):
  caesar( direction , text , n )
~~~

🟢 [See Project](https://github.com/koalba/PythonCourse/tree/main/07_DAY8/02_CaesarCipher)

## DAY 9 - Dictionaries, Nesting and the Secret Auction:

### · Grading Program ·

You have access to a database of `student_scores` in the format of a dictionary. The keys of the dictionary are the names of the students, and the values are their exam scores. <br />
Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of the program, you should have a dictionary called `student_grades` with the same structure as the other. <br />
Coding criteria: <br />
- Scores 91 - 100 : 'Outstanding'
- Scores 81 - 90  : 'Exceeds Expectations'
- Scores 71 - 80  : 'Acceptable'
- Scores 70 or lower  : 'Fail'

🟢 [See Project](https://github.com/koalba/PythonCourse/tree/main/08_DAY9/00_GradingProgram)

Write a program that adds to a `travel_log`. Write a function to add or modify this `travel_log` to add the name of the country, how many times you've visited it, and which cities. <br />
I've added the posibility to check the complete Travel Log, or just one country.<br />

A firs-price sealed-bid auction (FPSBA) or Blind Aucion is a type of aution in wich all bidders simultaneously submit sealed bids, so that no other bidder knows the bid of any other participant. <br />

🟢 [See Project](https://github.com/koalba/PythonCourse/tree/main/08_DAY9/02_TheSecretAuction)
