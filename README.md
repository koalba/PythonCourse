# PythonCourse
Well... I'm taking a Python course, and I'm going to document a bit mu Journey. At first I'll probably write less ( because easy ) but who knows if I end up writing more! For now, just the course little exercises.

## DAY 1 - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data:

### · Band Name Generator ·
Generate a Band Name with the user's city and pet name.

## DAY 2 - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings:

### · Data Type ·
Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. <br />
Modifyed to work for more than 2 digit numbers.

### · BMI Calculator ·
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) form a user's weight and height. <br />
The BMI is calculated by dividing the person's weight (kg) by the square of their height (m).

### · Your Life in Weeks ·
Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tell us how many days, weeks and months we have left if we live up to 90 years old. <br />
1 year = 365 days, 52 weeks and 12 months

### · Tip Calculator · 
<sup>DAY 1 - FINAL WORK</sup> <br />
Calculate the tip based on the total bill, the tip percentage and how many people are going to pay.

## DAY 3 - Control Flow and Logical Operators:

### · Odd or Even? ·
Write a program that works out wether if a given number is odd or even. <br />
Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

### · BMI 2.0 ·
Upgrade of the las BMI Calculator. <br />
It should tell the interpretation of their BMI based on the value: <br /> <br />
Less than 18.5 --- Underweight <br />
18.5 - 25 -------- Normal weight <br />
25 - 30 ---------- Overweight <br />
30 - 35 ---------- Obese <br />
Over 35 ---------- Clinically Obese <br />

### · Leap Year ·
Write a program that works out wether if a given year is a leap year. <br />
A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366 vith an extra day in February. <br />
'On every year that is evenly divisible by 4, except if that year is divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.'

### · Pizza Order Practice ·
Congratulations! You've got a job at Python Pizza. Your fist job is to build an automatic pizza order program. <br />
Based on the user's order, work out their final bill.

### · Love Calculator ·
Write a program that tests the compatibility between two people. <br />
Take both people's name and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. Then, check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. Combine these numbers to make a who digit number. <br /> <br />
Less than 10 or more than 90 --- 'You go together like coke and mentos' <br />
Between 40 and 50 --- 'You are alright together'

### · Treasure Island ·
Create a 'Choose your own adventure' Game using this flowchart: <br />
[Treasure Island Flowchart](https://viewer.diagrams.net/index.html?highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=Treasure%20Island%20Conditional.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1oDe4ehjWZipYRsVfeAx2HyB7LCQ8_Fvi%26export%3Ddownload)

## DAY 4 - Randomisation and Python Lists:

### · Head or Tails ·
Write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user 'Heads' or 'Tails'.

### · Banker Roullete - Who will pay the bill? ·
Write a program which will select a random name from a list. The person selected will have to play for everybody's food bill.

### · Treasure Map ·
Write a program which will mark a spot with an x. The map is made of 3 rows of blank squares. <br />
The program should allow you to enter the position of the treasure using a twi digit system. The first digit is the horizontal column number and the second is the vertical number. <br /> <br />
Modified to be a find the treasure game, with limited attempts to find it.

### · Rock Paper Scissors ·
Create a Rock Paper Scissors Game.

## DAY 5 - Python Loops:

### · Average Height ·
Write a program that calculates the average student height from a list of heights.

### · High Score ·
Write a program that calculates the highest score from a list of scores. Not allowed to use the min() max() functions.

### · Adding Even Numbers ·
Write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100, including both.

### · The FizzBuzz Job Interview Question ·
Write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game. <br />
- [x] Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
- [x] When the number is divisible by 3 the instead of the number, it should print 'Fizz'.
- [x] When the number is divisible by 5. then instead of the number, it should print 'Buzz'.
- [x] When the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 then instead of the number, it should print 'FizzBuzz'.

### · Password Generator ·
Write a Random Password Generator with the amount of letters, symbols and numbers chosen by the user. <br />

## DAY 6 - Python Functions & Karel:

## DAY 7 - Hangman:
