# PythonCourse

## DAY 1 - Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data:

### Band Name Generator
Generate a Band Name with the user's city and pet name.

## DAY 2 - Understanding Data Types and How to Manipulate Strings:

### Data Type
Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. <br />
Modifyed to work for more than 2 digit numbers.

### BMI Calculator
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) form a user's weight and height. <br />
The BMI is calculated by dividing the person's weight (kg) by the square of their height (m).

### Your Life in Weeks
Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tell us how many days, weeks and months we have left if we live up to 90 years old. <br />
1 year = 365 days, 52 weeks and 12 months

### Tip Calculator
Calculate the tip based on the total bill, the tip percentage and how many people are going to pay.

## DAY 3 - Control Flow and Logical Operators:

### Odd or Even?
Write a program that works out wether if a given number is odd or even. <br />
Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

### BMI 2.0
Upgrade of the las BMI Calculator. <br />
It should tell the interpretation of their BMI based on the value: <br /> <br />
Less than 18.5 --- Underweight <br />
18.5 - 25 -------- Normal weight <br />
25 - 30 ---------- Overweight <br />
30 - 35 ---------- Obese <br />
Over 35 ---------- Clinically Obese <br />

### Leap Year
Write a program that works out wether if a given year is a leap year. <br />
A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366 vith an extra day in February. <br />
'On every year that is evenly divisible by 4, except if that year is divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.'

### Pizza Order Practice
Congratulations! You've got a job at Python Pizza. Your fist job is to build an automatic pizza order program. <br />
Based on the user's order, work out their final bill.

### Love Calculator
Write a program that tests the compatibility between two people. <br />
Take both people's name and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. Then, check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. Combine these numbers to make a who digit number. <br /> <br />
Less than 10 or more than 90 --- 'You go together like coke and mentos' <br />
Between 40 and 50 --- 'You are alright together'

### Treasure Island
Create a 'Choose your own adventure' Game using this flowchart: <br />
